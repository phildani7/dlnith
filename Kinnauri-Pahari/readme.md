# **Kinnauri-Pahari Dataset**

The Kinnauri-Pahari dataset is an ongoing effort to create a collection of general-domain corpora for  one of seven endangered languages found in Himachal Pradesh, India.
Currently, this dataset has released under version_0.1, and it contains both the monolingual and parallel sentences.
TThe pre-trained word embeddings has been shared. The unsupervised Statistical and Neural Machine Translation results has been evaluated on multiple evaluation tasks.
For pre-processing, use the Indic NLP Library.

# __Text Corpora__
This dataset contains the Monolingual and Parallel data that was processed from the December-Feburary 2022. Containing n/a in Text file format.

# __Word Embeddings__
Word embedding is a vector representation of each word that can capture its context,  syntactic and semantic similarity, analogies, and relationships with other words.
[FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText), used to tokenize the corpus since it has a better word relationship. For crosslingual common embedding space, [Vecmap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap) is used.
