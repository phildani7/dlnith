# **Kinnauri-Pahari Dataset**

The Kinnauri-Pahari dataset is an ongoing effort to create a collection of general-domain corpora for  one of seven endangered languages found in Himachal Pradesh, India.
Currently, this dataset has released under version_0.1, and it contains both the monolingual and parallel sentences.
We share pre-trained word embeddings trained on these corpora. This dataset has been evaluated on multiple evaluation tasks i.e. Statistical and Neural Machine Translation.
For processing, you can use the Indic NLP Library.
